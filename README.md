Template show file for use with the Allen &amp; Heath GLD80, modification to include a useful but not exhaustive collection of library items to allow for quicker builds: \\

1. Vocal compressor settings (minus threshold).
2. Range of useful reverb settings (different lengths, styles and uses)
3. More niche processing (dynamic eq, multiband compression etc.)
4. Compression for ambient.
5. Compression for monitors.
6. EQ for different speakers.
7. Global EQ's for different rooms.
